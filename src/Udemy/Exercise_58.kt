 * Define a variable message as a String. Then define a list of prime numbers.
 * A function takes the list of integers and randomly returns one of them. Use it to initialize the message variable with a message including the returned prime number.
 * Print out the message.
 * This exercise can easily be solved in a way that doesnâ€™t use lateinit var. For the sake of practice, please use it in this case.
